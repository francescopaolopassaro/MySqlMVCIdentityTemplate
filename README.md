# MySqlMVCIdentityTemplate
C# MVC 5.0 Asp.net Identity MYSQL UOF Unity IOC
IDE Visual Studio 2012 + MVC 5

This version of the Code is intended as a template , a project born to unite the various technologies / pattern ( UnitOfWork , Unity IoC , aspnet Identity ) on Mysql database . I was inspired to make this commit because in the network there are no complete examples or not working . As a starting point I think it's pretty good .
I hope that others will find interesting this my solution and together help me to improve it through your feedback .
Thanks so much
